# JB2A Puzzle

## Overview

This module provides a compendium with several macros for use in creating a musical note password puzzle. In order to advance the players must match the code exactly to unlock some form of secret door.

## Credits
- Thanks to the <a href="https://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html">University of Iowa Musical Instrument Samples</a> for the piano samples!
- Thanks to @Ethck for the massive help at refactoring the module!

## Update
Thanks to @Appak and for letting us know we forgot to add a check for Forge in the 'Pressure Plate' macro. 
Now **actually** works in the Forge when the JB2A Patreon module is installed through the bazaar! Again, thanks @Ethck for this amazing reworks!
Also thanks to @Wasp for the oneliner, much better ;)
